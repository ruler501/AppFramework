Here is how the Android Code Works:
1. Include google's  In-App billing sdk in your code.
2. Include IInAppBillingService.aidl in your project from YOUR google sdk. My version could differ from yours.
3. PahelikaSecretLegendsFree.java is the main game activity. The package is "com.yourgame.droid.pahelikasecretlegends.hd.free2" Rename as per your Game and adjust the package path in eclipse.
4. Replace "<YOUR GOOGLE_PLAY_LICENSE_KEY>" with your google play license key
5. The InApp Billing helper code is located in src\com\ironcode\droid\util. Adjust the path as per your requirement and adjust the import path in your main activity.
6. Adjust application manifest to add billing permissions and Activity name etc.
7. The way this works is that PahelikaSecretLegendsFree is the main activity that derives from SDLActivity.
8. The C++ code calls into the java code in PahelikaSecretLegendsFree.java via JNI. The java code uses the helper classes to do the actual work.
9. You need to provide interface to c++ callback functions that will be called by the java code to provide purchase results. See the file ph_os_android_callbacks.h and ph_os_android_callbacks.cpp for an example.
